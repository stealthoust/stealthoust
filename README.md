### Hi World ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my portfolio! As a computer science student, I have experience in programming with Java, Spring, Angular, Node.js, TypeScript and many others. I have used these technologies to create a variety of projects, including web, desktop and mobile applications. I enjoy learning and discovering new technologies.
